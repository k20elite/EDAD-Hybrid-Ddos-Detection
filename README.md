# EDAD-Hybrid DDoS Detection

** Embedding-Driven Attention-based Detection** — AA hybrid framework fusing **DDoSBert** semantic embeddings with traditional tabular features for lightweight DDoS attack classification

## Overview

This project implements a hybrid model that fuses two types of features:
- **Tabular features** — Network flow statistics (duration, bytes/s, packets/s, etc.) processed through PCA
- **Semantic embeddings** — Generated by [DDoSBert](https://huggingface.co/Thi-Thu-Huong/DDoSBert), a BERT model fine-tuned for DDoS detection

An **Attention-based Fusion Layer** (PyTorch) merges both feature spaces before feeding into a Logistic Regression classifier.

## Pipeline

```
CSV Upload → EDA & Visualization → Data Cleaning
    → Label Encoding → Train/Test Split (70/30)
    → StandardScaler (fit on train) → SMOTE (train only)
    → PCA → DDoSBert Embedding Extraction
    → Attention Fusion → Logistic Regression
    → Evaluation + K-Fold Cross-Validation
```

## Key Features

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Dataset** | CICDDoS2019, AdDDoSDN |
| **Embedding Model** | `Thi-Thu-Huong/DDoSBert` (HuggingFace) |
| **Fusion** | Attention-weighted concatenation |
| **Classifier** | Logistic Regression (balanced) |
| **Balancing** | SMOTE (train set only — no data leakage) |
| **Validation** | Stratified 5-Fold Cross-Validation |
| **Reproducibility** | Full seed control (`RANDOM_SEED = 42`) |

## Requirements

```
torch
transformers
scikit-learn
imbalanced-learn
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
tqdm
```

> Designed to run on **Google Colab** with GPU. Dependencies are auto-installed via `!pip install`.

## Usage

1. Open the script in **Google Colab** 
2. Run all cells — you will be prompted to upload dataset
3. The pipeline runs end-to-end automatically
4. Results are saved to `hybrid_results_paper.json` and downloaded

## Output

- **Performance metrics** — Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, AUC, FPR
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **Complexity analysis** — Embedding time, training time, inference latency & throughput
- **Visualizations** — Class distribution, K-Fold box plots, t-SNE, performance bar chart
- **JSON results** — `hybrid_results_paper.json`
